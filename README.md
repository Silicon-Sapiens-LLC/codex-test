# Codex React App

This is a minimal React application using Vite, React Router, Zustand and Tailwind (shadcn). It demonstrates a login page and a protected home page with a sidebar menu.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

After logging in you can access additional menu items:

- **Dashboard** – displays a couple of fake charts rendered with [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/).
- **Users** – shows a list of sample users with the ability to add, edit and delete entries using modal dialogs.
